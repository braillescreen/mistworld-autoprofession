# MistWorld Auto Profession

This tiny patch for the MistWorld audio MMO RPG makes it possible to use profession skills (collect herbs, fishing and mining) in the background. To reduce redundant screen reader messages, it automatically closes the game after vitality has been exhausted. You can use it by doing the following:

* build or [download](https://github.com/cartertemm/mistworld-autoprofession/releases/download/v1.0/MistworldAutoProfession-1.0.nvda-addon) install the add-on package
* set up a profession skill key i.e. "c" (see game hotkeys for more information)
* press NVDA+SHIFT+backslash (\) to toggle the patch. Must be done outside the game's main window due to the blocking keyhook
* when you hear that it is enabled, you can go to a safe collection area and press i.e. c + backslash. The  add-on will handle the rest
